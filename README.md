# Material for the 2024 AI in Agriculture and Natural Resources Conference in College Station, TX (Under Construction)

This repository contains the code and sample (synthetic) datasets used in the ["Pre-conference Workshop 2: XGBOOST Your Digital Ag Research"](https://agriliferegister.tamu.edu/website/63088/#agenda), held on April, 15th 2024. In the workshop, we will explore the use and optimization of the XGBoost machine learning technique, alongside a comparison and optimization of the well-known Random Forest method.

## Requirements
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Create an environment with: os, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, and matplotlib.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can either clone this repository(preferable) or download the ZIP file and unzip it on your computer. 

This repository contains sample datasets that were used during the workshop. These datasets are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any other purpose. They were generated using real values, but they are synthetic.

## Code
This link contains the collab code: [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fkb_bNJG_JBqpJ6hWt3QQsLCQKOCrMK_)

## Paper
[This paper provides a detailed description of the methodology used for setting hyperparameters, establishes upper limits on the number of interactions based on justifications provided, and identifies threshold values for the random forest (RF) hyperparameters.]
